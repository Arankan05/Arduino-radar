# 🎯 Arduino Radar System

A simple **radar system** built using Arduino, a servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor.  
The project scans the surroundings with the servo and visualizes detected objects using a Processing sketch.  

👥 **Collaborators:** Arankan & Abishan

## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates how an **Arduino UNO**, an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, and an **SG90 servo motor** can be combined to create a radar-like system.  
The sensor sweeps across an angle using the servo and measures distances, while a Processing sketch displays the radar visualization on a computer screen.
